## Introduction
RIS-Vis is a web dashboard application built with the purpose of helping visualize seismic, geodetic, weather, & system monitoring data from the Seismo-Geodetic Ice Penetrator (SGIP) built by the MIT Haystack Observatory. The SGIP is an instrument with seismic and geodetic sensors embedded that will collect data from the Ross Ice Shelf when deployed. Since there is currently no data from the SGIP available (as it has not been launched yet), the web application in this repository uses a variety of publicly available data from the IRIS DMC, the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, & the University of Wisconsin-Madison Automatic Weather Station database. These sources respectively collect seismic, geodetic, and weather data from locations around Antarctica/the rest of the world, including the Ross Ice Shelf.
